Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
ans: we need data structure to store objects, data into it.
List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
ans: Test Automation, App Development
what is an Array?
ans: An Array is a special variable where multiple data can be stored.
what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
ans: In Array, index or element numbers are fixed. In ArrayList, index or element numbers grow dynamically.
what is LinkedList?
ans: LinkedList is a java built-in class which is used to manage list interface. It has it's own methods and properties.
what is queue?
ans: queue is a data structure which follows FIFO "first input first output" or LILO "last input last output"
what is stack?
ans: stack is a data structure which follows FILO "first input last output" or LIFO "last input first output"
what is FIFO and LIFO?
ans: FIFO= First input first output
      LIFO= Last input last output
what is the order of complexity?
ans: using algorithm.
what is the best case to search an element from an array?
ans: if the search value stay in the first index.
what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
ans: if the search value stay in the last index.
what is tree in data structure?
ans: in tree, multiple lists exist which looks like tree.
what is graph in data structure?
ans: graph is a data structure where data will be stored in a place where multiple rows and columns exist.
what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
ans: HashMap allows null key but HashTable doesn't allow null key.
What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
ans: Array, ArrayList, stack, queue, LinkedList, tree , HashMap, HashTable, graph
How HashMap works in java?
ans: HashMap is a class. it has methods and properties. we can use this methods and properties to do programming.
What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
ans: It is a method of Array class. This method returns a number when an array has been accessed with an illegal index.
What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
ans: using "copyof", "arraycopy", "clone" methods
What is difference between an array and a linked list?
ans: in array, index numbers are fixed. in LinkedList, index numbers are not fixed.
What is DFS and BFS?
ans: DFS-Depth first search, BFS-Bredth first search
What is Recursion?

What is Big-(O)-notation?

  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
